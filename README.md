# Get-MacOS-Version
Simple AppleScript app to get the macOS version of a targeted drive
Just reads the plist /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist to get the macOS version for the selected drive. Does not catch any errors but useful for not having to navigate to the plist yourself or typing into terminal
This can also just be made into a one line shell script but this way its pretty well trusted and will run on every version since OSX
